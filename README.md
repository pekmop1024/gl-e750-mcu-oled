# gl-e750-mcu-oled
GL.inet GL-E750 MCU OLED script for vanilla OpenWrt

## Disclaimer

Use at your own risk! Incorrect JSON can make MCU act weird, including shutting down the router, and in combination with running as background task it could lead to bootloops, however, there is always option for booting into OpenWrt failsafe mode and fixing script or removing it from autostart, so no worries :)

## Dependencies:
 * **gl-e750-mcu** (https://github.com/gl-inet/GL-E750-MCU-instruction)

 * **sms_tool** (available from OpenWrt repository)
 * **jq** (available from OpenWrt repository)
 * **mwan3.user** script (optional, for mwan3 interfaces status on custom screen)
   limitations due to custom message size (64 symbols max) and formatting:
